# Kodyliszek 🐉

## An ancient evil lurks in the depths of the Internet. It is cunning, menacing and relentless. If you have fallen into his trap and need help, do not be afraid. We are here.

## World Wild Web and all of it's creatures are no secret to us. We tame them, blunt them and subordinate them.

## This is what we do and we do it well.
